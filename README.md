# Atom Weave.jl Builder

## THIS REPOSITORY WAS RECENTLY FORKED, AND HASN'T BEEN UPDATED

In particular, its eventual goals are listed below, but it doesn't yet meet them.
Come back later -- still under construction!

-----

A builder for `.jmd` files in Atom, using [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl).

This is a plugin for the latest version of
[atom-build](https://atom.io/packages/build), which is a package that lets you
run build scripts based on what files are in your project. This plugin, in
particular, will run the [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) script
[Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl) on the currently open `.jmd` file,
compiling it.  See the [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl) documentation
for more details.

Thanks to [Blake Winton](https://github.com/bwinton) for the
[atom-build-markdown](https://github.com/bwinton/atom-build-markdown) project,
from which this is a fork.
